# Defaulters maching learning classifier using Python

This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and belongs to a Hackathon organized by "Univ.AI".

An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product. They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. Hence when they acquire new customers they want to predict who is riskier and who is not.

The task is to predict possible defaulters for the consumer loans product based on the customer historic behavior with possible defaulters with Risk_Flag == 1 and 0 for not possible for being a defaulter.
